# Reflection — My Learning Experience

Working on the **FuelEU Maritime Compliance Platform** was one of the most complete projects I’ve done so far. It helped me connect a lot of different skills — from database design to frontend development — and also taught me how to use AI tools in a practical way without depending on them completely.

I learned how to plan a full-stack project properly using the **Hexagonal Architecture**, where every layer has a clear purpose. Earlier, I used to just start coding directly, but this time I really understood how separating the core logic from the framework makes the code more organized and easier to manage. I also learned how to model data using Prisma and PostgreSQL, write APIs in Node.js, and connect them with a React + Tailwind frontend.

Apart from coding, I also understood how to think like an engineer — breaking a large project into smaller pieces and testing them one by one.

## How AI Helped

I used ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot mainly for guidance and boilerplate code.  
For example, I asked ChatGPT to help me set up the backend folder structure and Prisma schema, and it gave me a good starting point.  
Copilot helped in writing repetitive code like interfaces, types, and small React functions.

These tools saved a lot of time during setup and helped me focus on understanding the logic.  
But still, I didn’t just copy-paste what they gave — I tried to understand every line, debug the errors, and make the final version myself.  
This process made me more confident in reading and fixing code generated by AI.

## Challenges and Fixes

There were times when AI suggestions were wrong or incomplete.  
For example:
- The Prisma `DATABASE_URL` issue took some trial and error.
- A few API endpoints didn’t work at first because of path issues.
- In the frontend, I had to handle missing data cases manually when APIs returned errors.

These problems actually helped me learn debugging more deeply. I started checking console logs, testing endpoints in Postman, and verifying database entries in Prisma Studio — all things I didn’t pay much attention to earlier.

## What I’ll Do Better Next Time

If I do this project again, I would:
- Write proper unit and integration tests.
- Add authentication and roles for admin and users.
- Try to deploy it using Docker.
- Maybe use real maritime emission data to make it more meaningful.

## Final Thoughts

AI tools made this project faster and easier to manage, but they didn’t replace the effort needed to understand the problem.  
I realized that AI can help in generating structure, but the real logic, design, and debugging still depend on the developer.  

This project taught me not just technical skills, but also how to use AI smartly — as a helper, not a shortcut.
